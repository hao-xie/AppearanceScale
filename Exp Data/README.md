# Experiment Stimuli & Results

The files in this folder contain the experimental stimuli and results.

"ExpResult_G0Avg_IndObs.xlsx" includes the G0-based brightness scaling results for both individual and average observers. Different levels of G0's along the brightness scale can be found.

"ExpResult_SatAvg_IndObs.xlsx" includes the saturation scale data for the equally bright colors, which were based on MacAdam optimal colors (equvalently G0's).

More details can also be found in each file's own intro tab.
